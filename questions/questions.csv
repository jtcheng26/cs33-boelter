- No, Mutual Exclusion
- No, Hold and Wait
- No, No Preemption
- No, Circular Wait","In the game of spoons, a player wins if they are holding 2 cards of the same number, and in each set of cards, there are only 2 cards of each number. There are at least as many card numbers as there are players in the game.
- Turns are unordered and untimed: players take a ""turn"" whenever they want to, and multiple turns can be taken at once. Assume that players will always take a turn if they are able to, but players may take different amounts of time to take a single turn.
- Each person starts with 1 card.
- A turn consists of draining some number of cards, and discarding some number of cards. By default, a player draws 1 card, bringing their hand to 2 cards, and if not winning immediately, discarding one of the 2 cards.
- A discarded card can be drawn by another player
- When a player ""wins"", they immediately stop playing, but other players may continue to play until they win
- Assume that players will follow the collective strategy listed below, and will not deviate from it under any circumstances
By default, when a player draws a new card, they compare it to their existing card, and if it doesn't match, discard the card they just drew.

- Interrupt
- Trap
- Fault
- No exception would occur","Suppose a program, program.c, has code which dereferences a null pointer. What kind of exception would arise from running program.c?","Answer: Fault, this would result in a segmentation fault. While it can be argued that this could result in an abort, as it is unrecoverable, it is important to note that the act of pausing hte program to attempt to retrieve the data at the address of the nullptr is a fault in of itself. Thus, a segmentation fault is a fault which leads into an abort."
