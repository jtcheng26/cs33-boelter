Using the below table, translate 0x003a5b into a physical address, assuming that virtual addresses are 32 bits, physical addresses are 20 bits, and pages are 4KB. Answer in hexadecimal, like 0x1234, and if the memory address is invalid, submit "invalid".

Hint: the first row of the table corresponds with the 0th page, the second row the 1st page, etc.
