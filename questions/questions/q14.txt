Fill in the blanks with the minimal amount of text while still keeping functionality the exact same even if the pragma line is removed:

int j, x;
int a = 0;

#pragma omp parallel for private(___) reduction(______)
for (j = 0; j < 1000000; j++) {
  for (k = 0; k < 5; k++) {
    x = calc(j, x);
    a += x;
  }
}
